Add comparator to SearchResultEntry nodes (filter the nodes rather than the entries so we dont have to recreate the FXML)
Use icons in search result boxes
Fix updating find page after adding entry (EntryCache is updated but search results node cache is not) (THIS STILL NOT WORKING) (email isn't updating)
Find where (if implemented) where we restrict trying to create an "Entrie" table only if it doesn't already exist (Update NOTES.txt with this info)
