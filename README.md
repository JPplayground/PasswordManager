# Password Manager
Hey there! This project is a work in progress towards building a simple and effective password management system.
Right now it is incomplete, with only basic features and a very simple GUI.  

## Main Goals for the Project 

- Migrate to Electron for the UI
- Give the user the option of storing passwords locally (currently implemented) or cloud based storage
- Implement a rich feature set for organizing and managing credentials
- A dashboard statistical view of your various accounts with indications for duplicate and old passwords
